%description

This RPM packages up an Eclipse project containing the Java source code 
for plugins and node builder programs created by Temerity Software for
a specific studio client.  After installing this RPM, a studio can then
use Eclipse to build the contained Java code against their locally 
installed version of Pipeline. 

We recommend that studios copy the installed source code an Eclipse 
project files to another location after installing this RPM and use
a version control system to maintain the code. It is likely that a
studio will continue internal development on the code supplied by
this RPM so it would be wise to protect any modified code from being
overwritten by future installs of this RPM.
