<h2>Pipeline Manual</h2>
<br>
models a
production process as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) containing nodes
which represent collections of data files and the executables that
operate upon those data files. The links (or connections) in the DAG
are
based on the dependency relationship of the nodes in the production
process. The nodes and their connections are stored in a database
and <a href="file://@datadir@/docs/pipeline.html"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">pipeline</span></a>(1) commands are used to
access and modify the contents of this database and the associated
data files.<br>
<br>
All data files associated with these nodes are revision controlled by <a
 href="file://@datadir@/docs/pipeline.html"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">pipeline</span></a>(1) using an approach
similar to the popular Concurrent Versions System (see&nbsp;<a
 href="http://www.cvshome.org/docs/"><b>cvs</b></a>(1)). As with CVS,
all revisions are stored in a central repository and each user has a
separate working area where copies (or links) of specific revisions are
stored. File sharing between users is mediated by <a
 href="file://@datadir@/docs/pipeline.html"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">pipeline</span></a>(1) so that changes to
files or process scripts by one user do not immediately affect other
users. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Along with version tracking and logging, <a
 href="file://@datadir@/docs/pipeline.html"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">pipeline</span></a>(1) also stores
information with each revision about the specific executables used in
both interactive editing and automatic regeneration of data files
and the environment in which these processes are executed.&nbsp;
Using this information, <a href="file://@datadir@/docs/pipeline.html"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">pipeline</span></a>(1) is able to
reconstruct the entire production process and automate submission of
jobs to a batch processing queue.
