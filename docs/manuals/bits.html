<h3><a name="Node_Names_and_File_System_Paths"></a><a
 href="file:///code/src/pipeline/src/java/docs/pipeline.html.in#Contents">Node
Names and File System Paths</a><br>
</h3>
<blockquote> The last argument to all <a
 href="file://@datadir@/docs/pipeline.html"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">pipeline</span></a>(1) commands is a name
which identifies the data/process node. All nodes have a unique name in
the database which resembles a file system path. For example, a data
node associated with a set of RIB files could be named:<br>
  <blockquote>"/projectX/maya/rib/deathray"<br>
  </blockquote>
Its important to note that this name is not a literal file system path.
However, the above name is used in combination with several other node
properties to construction literal file system paths. <br>
  <h4><a name="Files_and_File_Sequences"></a>Files and File Sequences<br>
  </h4>
  <blockquote> Process nodes can only be associated with a single
script
file which when executed performs the process. Data nodes, however, are
a little more complicated. Some data nodes are associated with a single
file, while others are associated with a sequence of files which share
a
common naming convention. Examples of single data nodes include texture
maps, models and scene files. &nbsp;Sequence data nodes are commonly
used for sequences of images in an animation, per-frame input files for
renderers (such as RIB files) and data files associated with
simulations. &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
In order to support this complexity, several options to the <a
 href="file:///code/src/pipeline/src/java/docs/pipeline.html.in#register"><b>register</b></a>
command are provided to which
allow the user to specify frame ranges (<a
 href="file:///code/src/pipeline/src/java/docs/pipeline.html.in#--range">--range</a>),
frame number padding (<a
 href="file:///code/src/pipeline/src/java/docs/pipeline.html.in#--pad">--padding</a>)
and file name
suffixes (<a
 href="file:///code/src/pipeline/src/java/docs/pipeline.html.in#--suffix">--suffix</a>).
    <br>
    <br>
One important restriction to keep in mind is that the padding, frame
range an suffix properties of a data node are fixed at the point of
node
registration and cannot be modified once a node has been checked-in.
The
reason behind this rather severe restriction is that the literal file
names associated with nodes are commonly referenced inside dependent
nodes downstream and any change in file naming convention would cause
widespread errors and failures when these dependent nodes are later
evaluated. If a change in required in these properties, a new node
(with
a different name) should be created by cloning the old node instead (<a
 href="file:///code/src/pipeline/src/java/docs/pipeline.html.in#--clone">--clone</a>).<br>
  </blockquote>
  <h4><a name="Working_Area_Paths"></a>Working Area Paths</h4>
  <blockquote> The path most important to users is the location of the
associated files within their per-user working area directories. Each
user is assigned a directory with the same name as their username under
the central working area (see <a
 href="file:///code/src/pipeline/src/java/docs/pipeline.html.in#--working">--working</a>
option). Under this per-user directory, the structure mirrors that of
the repository but only contains versions of files which are actively
being used, hence the name "working" area. &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
In order to facilitate the sharing of files with internal references to
file system paths, the $WORKING environmental variable is defined by <a
 href="file://@datadir@/docs/pipeline.html"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">pipeline</span></a>(1) when executing
process node scripts and launching editors. Users should always use
this environmental variable (instead of its value) in any file system
path references to insure that the the paths remain valid when used by
another user with a different working area location.<br>
    <br>
The value of $WORKING is set to the fully qualified filesystem path of
the root of the user's working area directory structure. More
specifically, $WORKING is set as if the following bash shell script
fragment was executed:<br>
    <blockquote>&gt; WORKING=`pipeline --working`/$USER<br>
    </blockquote>
For example, assuming a padding of "4", a suffix of "rib" and a frame
range of "1-5x2", the path to the working files associated with the
example node above are:<br>
    <blockquote>"$WORKING/projectX/maya/rib/deathray.0001.rib"<br>
"$WORKING/projectX/maya/rib/deathray.0003.rib"<br>
"$WORKING/projectX/maya/rib/deathray.0005.rib"<br>
    </blockquote>
Notice that the above paths contain no mention of the specific revision
of "deathray" stored under the per-user working area. Version
information is stored in the database instead of cluttering up file
names. This way any references to "deathray" stored in other files
or scripts will never have to be modified when newer versions of
"deathray" are released. All such references should use fully
qualified working area paths similar the previous example. This
protects users from unexpected changes in the naming of files they use
while simplifying the steps required to use new versions.<br>
    <br>
Working files may be either copies or symbolic links to a specific
revision stored in the repository depending on the options used during
file check-out. Generally, symbolic links are only used for files which
are large and do not need to be locally modified.<br>
  </blockquote>
  <h4><a name="Repository_Paths"></a>Repository Paths</h4>
  <blockquote> All users working on the same production share a central
repository directory structure where all revisions which have been
checked-in are stored (see the <a
 href="file:///code/src/pipeline/src/java/docs/pipeline.html.in#--repository">--repository</a>
option). Continuing with the example, the "2.5.1" version of the
"deathray" sequence of RIBs would be stored in the repository as:<br>
    <blockquote> "&lt;<i>repository</i>&gt;/projectX/maya/rib/deathray/v2.5.1/deathray.0003.rib"<br>
"&lt;<i>repository</i>&gt;/projectX/maya/rib/deathray/v2.5.1/deathray.0003.rib"<br>
"&lt;<i>repository</i>&gt;/projectX/maya/rib/deathray/v2.5.1/deathray.0005.rib"<br>
    </blockquote>
All files and directories in the repository are read-only and should
never be directly modified or referenced by an artist. Instead, the <a
 href="file://@datadir@/docs/pipeline.html"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">pipeline</span></a>(1) tool should be used
to perform all changes to the contents of the repository. Due to these
restrictions, there is no equivalent environmental variable to $WORKING
defined for the repository path.<br>
  </blockquote>
  <h4><a name="Relative_Names"></a>Relative Names</h4>
  <blockquote> The (<i>name</i>) argument to <a
 href="file://@datadir@/docs/pipeline.html"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">pipeline</span></a>(1) commands can always
be given as a fully qualified node name (i.e. without the $WORKING
prefix or possible file sequence suffixes). As a convenience, when <a
 href="file://@datadir@/docs/pipeline.html"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">pipeline</span></a>(1) is executed within a
subdirectory of $WORKING, a shorter relative path may be used to refer
to nodes. For instance, the following would be a valid way of referring
to the example node:<br>
    <blockquote>&gt; cd $WORKING/projectX/maya<br>
&gt; pipeline <i>command [options ...]</i> rib/deathray<br>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>

<h3><a name="Editors"></a><a
 href="file://@datadir@/docs/pipeline.html#Contents">Editors</a></h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">For each node, <a
 href="file://@datadir@/docs/pipeline.html"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">pipeline</span></a>(1) stores the name of
an appropriate editor for viewing and modifying the data files
associated with the node. &nbsp;The editor can be set for a node using
the <a
 href="file:///code/src/pipeline/src/java/docs/pipeline.html.in#--editor">--editor</a>
option. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Because of the complexities of file sequences and the arbitrary nature
of command line options for editor programs, <a
 href="file://@datadir@/docs/pipeline.html"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">pipeline</span></a>(1) uses Java based
plugins for each registered editor to handle the specific calling
conventions of the editor executables. &nbsp;Most useful editor
programs
for the CG industry are already covered by <a
 href="file://@datadir@/docs/pipeline.html"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">pipeline</span></a>(1), but this list can
be extended by writing a custom Java plugin for your site. &nbsp;See
the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pipeline Plugins</span> document

explanation of this mechanism. <br>

<h3><a name="Actions"></a><a
 href="file:///code/src/pipeline/src/java/docs/pipeline.html.in#Contents">Actions</a></h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">One of the primary features of <a
 href="file://@datadir@/docs/pipeline.html"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">pipeline</span></a>(1) is the ability to
regenerate the data file(s) associated with a node through execution of
some process on the local machine or render queue. This process is
refered to as the regeneration action (or just action) for a node.
&nbsp;Each node has one of the following associated actions:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 name="None"></a>None</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
The simplest possible action which does nothing. &nbsp;This is the
default action for nodes (see <a
 href="file:///code/src/pipeline/src/java/docs/pipeline.html.in#--action">--noaction</a>).
&nbsp;This action has no parameters.<br>
<br>
</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 name="Script"></a>Script</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
This action executes a text script using an arbitrary interpreter. This
highly flexible action can be used to do just about anything. The only
limitation of ScriptAction's is that the script is only passed the most
basic information about its associated node and therefore must be
hardcoded to do a specific job. &nbsp;By contrast, most of the other
actions are very generic and produce very different results depending
on
the node with which they are associated. ScriptActions have the
following parameters:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Interpreter</span><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">This is the name of program which will
be used as the interpreter for the ScriptText. &nbsp;This can be any
program that can be used with the "!#" notation as the first line of a
shell script. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Common values include: "bash", "sh", "csh" and "perl".</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">ScriptText</span><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
The literal text of the script to be interpreted by the Interpreter.

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The name of the node who's primary file
is the Maya scene to render. &nbsp;This render scene node must also be
