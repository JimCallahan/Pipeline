Issues that need to be addressed for auto-preemption:


+ Preempting jobs should not be started until preempted jobs have exited.  This means that
  starting the new preempting job must be done after an indeterminate delay after killing 
  the existing preempted job.


+ The preempted job may hold license keys required by the preempting job.  These keys are 
  not released until the preempted job exits.  

  - The condition that the license keys are available needs to be relaxed to consider whether 
    the preempted job can supply these license keys.

  - Once the decision to preempt has been made, all license keys required by the preempting
    job must be aquired (or reserved in the case where the preempted job currently holds
    the key) so that normally dispatched jobs cannot steal the requird keys before the 
    preempting job is started.


+ The dynamic job requirements (load average, memory, disk) of the preempting job cannot 
  be known before preempting the exising jobs.
