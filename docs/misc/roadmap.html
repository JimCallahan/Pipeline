<H1><A NAME="SECTION00020000000000000000">
1 Overview</A>
</H1>

<P>
This document outlines the future course of P<SMALL>IPELINE</SMALL> development
over the next couple months. It contains solutions to the problems
encountered during use of the beta version of P<SMALL>IPELINE</SMALL> on
the ATI demo project at RhinoFX. This will serve as a guide to the
tasks remaining before P<SMALL>IPELINE</SMALL> is ready for its initial
commercial release.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">
2 Performance</A>
</H1>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00031000000000000000">
2.1 Database </A>
</H2>

<P>
The SQL database will be replaced with a custom server program written
in Java which will be able to represent the tree-like data structures
inherent to P<SMALL>IPELINE</SMALL> in a vastly more efficient manner. Much
of the time currently spent by users waiting on status updates while
using <I>plui(1)</I> and <I>pipeline(1)</I> is related to the large
numbers of queries required to traverse tree-like data strucutures
in SQL. Also, some of the critical queries where themselves very costly
and didn't scale well for large numbers of users or nodes.

<P>
The replacement database will be composed of a set of Java objects
which can be saved and restored from disk in a human readable text
format. The database server will provide a high level interface to
manipulating these Java objects and manage all thread and transaction
related issues internally.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00032000000000000000">
2.2 File System </A>
</H2>

<P>
Whenever a user requests an status update, e needs to examine potentially
large numbers of files in order to compute a correct status for the
associated nodes. The information required for these files usually
is fairly lightweight and consists of determining file existence,
file size and last modified time stamps. In some cases, an expensive
checksum may need to be generated for files which have been modified.
In both cases though, this file system activity is taking place over
the network via NFS. One of the problems with this approach is that
the latency associated with checking file status over NFS becomes
significant when hundreds of files are involved. Even more problematic
is the cost of moving entire files over the network merely to generate
checksums. Lastly, even though a complex tree of nodes may involve
hundred of associated files, it is highly unlikely that all of the
files have actually changed since the last status update. Currently,
every file is checked with every update regardless if it has changed
or not.

<P>
A possible solution to the network latency and transmission cost issues
would be to use a custom file status server program to manage file
changes. This file status server program would be run on the file
server, this way all files related to P<SMALL>IPELINE</SMALL> would be accessed
locally and bypassing NFS altogether. If the file server hardware
was incapable of running the file status server program (NetApp),
it could be run on a dedicated machine with very fast access to the
file server. This server program could check large numbers of files
with much lower network activity and latency. If checksums need to
be generated, the source files would not have to be transmitted over
the network.

<P>
The problem of redundently checking files which haven't changed can
be solved by using a feature of the Linux kernel called DNotify. This
feature allows programs to register interest in certain directories
and be notified (via signals) when files are created, deleted and
modified in these directories. The file status server could maintain
an internal table of information related to files associated with
active nodes and only update this table when notified by the kernel
that a change has occurred.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00033000000000000000">
2.3 Lightweight Clients </A>
</H2>

<P>
When a user requests a status update, P<SMALL>IPELINE</SMALL> currently
must gather and analyze a large amount of database and file system
data to compute a small amount of state information for each node.
The source data for this computation must be moved over the network.
In addition, a large percentage of this source data is usually accessed
multiple times and possibly by more than one client program between
changes to the source data. 

<P>
Status updates could be made more efficient if they where computed
lazily on the server-side in response to file system change notifications,
node operations and queue activity. Only those nodes which are actively
being monitored by Pipeline clients programs would need to be updated.
When new node states are generated on the server, only the changed
state information would need to be sent to clients.

<P>
Another benefit of this approach would be the elimination of the need
for users to manually request the state of nodes. Instead, the client
programs would simply always display the latest known state information
without repeated user status requests. This should improve useability
and eliminate some user confusion related to viewing stale node state
information.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00040000000000000000">
3 Nodes</A>
</H1>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00041000000000000000">
3.1 Multiple Working Areas</A>
</H2>

<P>
Currently, each user has a working directory where all files associated
with their working copies of nodes reside. This prevents changes to
working area files from being seen by other users and allows each
user to have their own version of a particular node. However, each
user can only have a single copy of a given file in their working
area at one time. This is usually not a problem, but there are some
cases where this limitation causes difficulty. For example, a user
might be rendering a Maya scene, but wants to be able to work on textures
or model files being referenced by the running render.

<P>
The solution is to allow user to have more than one working area.
Users should be allowed to create, destroy and change the active working
area on demand. Each working area will be treated as if it was a seperate
user. Changes made in one working area can be communicated to other
working areas using the usual check-in/out mechanism.

<P>
Currently, P<SMALL>IPELINE</SMALL> provides an environmental variable called
``WORKING'' which contains the path to the current user's working
directory. To support multiple working areas, this variable will be
replaced with a pair of variables ``PLWORK'' and ``PLVIEW''
which when used together (i.e. ``$PLWORK/$PLVIEW''). When editors
or regeneration actions are launched by P<SMALL>IPELINE</SMALL>, these variables
will be set to point to the proper working area directory for the
node involved.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00042000000000000000">
3.2 Node References</A>
</H2>

<P>
Nodes can currently only be connected based on dependency relationships.
Changes to upstream nodes cause all downstream nodes to become stale
and require regeneration using the job queue. This works well for
the core functionality of Pipeline, but is overly strict or undesirable
to represent all kinds of node relationships.

<P>
Node references provide a way to connection nodes which have a relationship
which isn't a dependency. Instead of having the dependency O<SMALL>PTION</SMALL>
and O<SMALL>FFSET</SMALL> parameters, references will have a T<SMALL>YPE</SMALL>
parameter. Users can create new reference types on demand to document
the nature of the relationship. 

<P>
When displaying trees of nodes, each type of reference can be optionally
displayed or ignored. Reference links will be displayed differently
than dependency links and will be labeled with the reference type
name. 

<P>
Another difference between dependencies and references is that nodes
on the upstream side of a reference link will not affect the state
of the downstream node and will not be regenerated by ``make''
operations initiated on the downstream side of the link.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00043000000000000000">
3.3 Non-Stale Property Modifications</A>
</H2>

<P>
Whenever any node property is changed, it causes node's with regeneration
actions to become stale and therefore require regeneration before
they can be checked-in. In most cases this is desirable, since the
property changes are not reflected in the files associated with the
modified node. However, there are some node properties (editor, job
requirements, etc...) which cannot affect the contents of the associated
files and therefore should not cause the node to become stale when
they are changed. However, the node would still become modified when
one of these properties is changed to that these changed are properly
handled by the check-in/out system.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00044000000000000000">
3.4 Node Tree Display and Layout</A>
</H2>

<P>
Node trees are currently displayed by starting at some picked node
and traversing the upstream dependency links until all leaf nodes
are reached. Any nodes reachable by more than one path are displayed
multiple times. There is a single viewing area which can display more
than one tree can at a time.

<P>
This will be replaced by multiple tabbed viewing areas in which each
view contains a single tree of nodes. Two new layout styles will be
added to the current upstream layout style. The downstream layout
will display the inverse tree of nodes which depend on a single upstream
node. The bidirectional layout will display both upstream and downstream
trees centered on a single node. 

<P>
Any particular viewing area should be easily toggled between these
three layout styles. Each style uses a single key node as the starting
point for the layout. When the layout style is changed, the key node
will remain the same. When a node is selected for display (left side
of <I>plui(1)</I>) they replace the key node for the currently selected
viewing area tab. In addition, any currently viewed node can be made
the key node for a particular viewing area tab. Tabs can be added
and removed on demand much like the tabs in Mozilla. 

<P>
Only the currently viewed tab will be considered when communicating
with the database and file servers to update node status. In other
words, there would be no overhead to having many tabs since only one
of them is active at any one time. 

<P>
One key difference in terms of status update is that nodes downstream
of the key node will not have their status evaluated. These downstream
side nodes will be rendered gray and without status symbols since
their status is undefined. All node operations (check-in/out, make,
etc..) will also be disabled for these nodes. The reason for this
restriction becomes clear when you consider the huge number of nodes
which would need to be considered when the key node is a commonly
used dependency such as a model node. Computing the status of the
entire tree would then become equivalent to computing the status of
all node trees which reference the key node. If status information
is desired for one of the downstream side nodes, it can be obtained
by changing the key node to one further downstream.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00045000000000000000">
3.5 Node Deletion</A>
</H2>

<P>
Once a node has been checked-in, it cannot ever be removed. This is
usually exactly what is desired, since the permenancy of repository
versions is one of the core functions of P<SMALL>IPELINE</SMALL>. However,
sometimes a user creates and checks-in a node which is badly named
to placed in a awkward location. Ideally, these kind of mistakes should
be noticed before checking-in the node, but sometimes mistakes are
made. 

<P>
P<SMALL>IPELINE</SMALL> should provide a way to destroy a node and all of
its checked-in repository versions and associated files to deal with
problem nodes. All references to the deleted node would also be removed.
This operation should only be accessable to priviledged users, such
as system administrators or supervisors, since irreparable damage
could be done by deleting the wrong node. 

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00046000000000000000">
3.6 File Deletion</A>
</H2>

<P>
Pipeline should provide an operation which would remove a specific
file or all files assocated with a node. This is sometimes desirable
when the regeneration action has touched the file, but then crashed
or otherwise failed to finish writing the file properly. Currently,
Pipeline would consider the file to up-to-date and will refuse to
regenerate it. This file deletion operation provides a way work around
problems of this kind.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00047000000000000000">
3.7 Needs Check-Out Symbols</A>
</H2>

<P>
Currently, the Needs Check-Out state for a node is represented by
a single symbol (upside-down delta). In the future, Pipeline should
display a range of symbols which correspond to the level of difference
between the latest repository version number and the working version
number for a node. This way the user can easily tell the difference
between a minor change which can probably be safely ignored in the
short term and a major change which should be dealt with immediately.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00048000000000000000">
3.8 Modifyable Primary Frame Range</A>
</H2>

<P>
The frame range of the primary file sequence associated with a node
is currently fixed at the time of node creation. Pipeline should be
changed to allow the user to modify this parameter in the future.
To help prevent confusion, whenever the frame range is changed, all
associated files who's frame numbe are outside the new range should
be removed at the time of the frame range change. This will help to
keep the filesystem and node information current with each other as
the set of files associated with a node evolves.

</H1>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00051000000000000000">
4.1 Incremental Output</A>
</H2>

<P>
Each line of output from standard out/error of running jobs will be
captured as it is output from the job. Users will be able to monitor
this output while jobs are running by opening a dialog for the job.
Each line of output will be transmitted via a network connection from
the job monitoring daemon to each P<SMALL>IPELINE</SMALL> client with an
open job output dialog. Upon job exit, all output will be stored in
the database as usual.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00052000000000000000">
4.2 Job Failure from Output</A>
</H2>

<P>
Some programs, notably Maya, fail to return a non-zero exit status
for some failure conditions. What is needed is a flexible way to parse
the output for signs that something has gone wrong and possibly even
kill the job. For example, missing texture files will not cause Maya
to fail but the results of allowing the rendering to continue are
less than ideal. It would be good to be able to optionally request
that Pipeline treat a missing texture as a failure and thereby avoid
further downstream processing.

<P>
A solution would be to add a method to the regeneration action plugin
API which would be called after each line of output from the action's
subprocess and return a boolean value for whether processing should
continue. The default implementation would always return true. Actions
could provide controls over the output parsing as action parameters.

<P>

5 Customization</A>
</H1>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00061000000000000000">
5.1 Tool API</A>
</H2>

<P>
P<SMALL>IPELINE</SMALL> models the production process in a fairly abstract
manner. Features common to any conceivable production are implemented
as core functionality. However, it is often the case that a particular
production or studio has specialized needs which may not be generally
desirable to include as a core feature of P<SMALL>IPELINE</SMALL>.

<P>
The current version supports three mechanisms for extending P<SMALL>IPELINE</SMALL>:
editor plugins, action plugins and batch scripts. P<SMALL>IPELINE</SMALL>
comes with a rich set of editor and action plugins to support the
common industry programs and these can be extended by writing a custom
Java classes. Batch scripts allow a set of Pipeline operations to
be scripted and executed on the command-line, but the limitation of
communicating with command-line arguments makes doing more complicated
operations difficult.

<P>
To support more arbitrarily complex operations and avoid awkward command-line
syntax, a new Java based API will be provided which gives access to
nearly all P<SMALL>IPELINE</SMALL> functionality. This API can be used in
two ways. Standalone Java programs can use the API to make new kinds
of P<SMALL>IPELINE</SMALL> clients. Tool plugins can be written which when
loaded by <I>plui(1)</I> will provide additional high-level functionality
to the user. When loaded as a plugin, the tool will be able to create
its own dialogs for getting collecting input from the user.

<P>
Tools could be written using this API to implement functionality such
as setting up a commonly used hierarchy of nodes, performing a repetitive
operation on a large number of nodes or communicating with third party
software.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00062000000000000000">
5.2 Editor and Action Plugins</A>
</H2>

<P>
The current set of core editors and actions is incomplete. Notably
support for Softimage, RenderMan and Mental Ray needs to be added.
The fcheck(1) editor plugin is less than ideal and other image playback
programs need to be supported. Some common desktop text editors such
as kedit(1) need to be added. 

<P>
There is also a problem with the way editors are launched which causes
them to be killed when plui(1) exits. This is usually not desirable
and can sometimes be very damaging when the user has not saved their
work.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00063000000000000000">
5.3 User Preferences</A>

User preferences should be extended to support custom colors for all
UI elements, time/date formatting and hot keys for all P<SMALL>IPELINE</SMALL>
operations and UI navigation menu items.

6.1 Backup and Restore</A>
</H2>

<P>
Backup of the repository files should be more selective than simply
backing up the entire repository directory. Once a particular version
of a file has been backed up, there is no need to process it every
backup cycle. P<SMALL>IPELINE</SMALL> should provide support for determining
when a repository file was created and produce an incremental listing
of files which need to be backed up. The database should also store
a list of backup tapes or other media which contain a particular repository
version. Also, there needs to be a way to backup a running P<SMALL>IPELINE</SMALL>
database without stopping the database server.

<P>
Similarly, there is currently no support for using the database to
determine which files can safely be off-lined or how to locate and
restore off-lined files associated with nodes when needed. The database
representation of nodes need to be extended to contain information
which will identify the tape or other permanent storage media which
contains an off-lined set of repository files. Some additional P<SMALL>IPELINE</SMALL>
commands are needed to identify rarely used nodes and package up the
needed data to archive these nodes. This functionality should be supported
by pipeline(1) so that it can be used in automated setting such as
cron(1).

There already exists man-page style documentation for all command

the bigger picture of how P<SMALL>IPELINE</SMALL> is actually used in a
production environment. A user manual is needed which will explain
