ACTIONS:

- Add output parsing method which can trigger a kill of the job and updates a completion 
  percentage field.

- Add a job server resourecs method similar to the output parsing methods above.

- Port the old Pipeline actions to work with the new Pipeline.

- Get Jesse's fix to the old MayaCollate.

- Write Action classes for the remaining common CG tasks...  Finish Output OP support 
  in Houdini.  Add all supported Maya renderer related actions: MentalRay and Maya Renderers.
  Maya simulation actions: particle systems, dynamics, cloth, fluid dynamics.  Generic MEL
  action.  Add 3Delight rendering.  XSI supprt?  Simple compositing actions?

- Add thumbnail generation method?


OPERATIONS/BACKEND: 

- Task/Scheduling System

- The commandline should be updated in QueueJobInfo as soon as the job is launched 
  so that the user doesn't have to wait for the QueueJobResults (at the end of the job).

- Add a "Release View" operation which performs "Release" on all nodes in the view and 
  then deletes the view and optionally the entire production subdirectory for the view.
  If any nodes cannot be released, then the operation is aborted early and the offending
  nodes are reported.


ADMINISTRATION: 

- Automated cleanup of Job Server sample files older than a given interval.

- Automated Backup of Node/Queue database and production working areas.

- Node and File Online/Offline System

- Rotating log files.


USER INTERFACE: 

- File browsers should use double clicks to traverse directories.

- Add simultaneous multiple column field changes in all tables.

- Editors should use the node's parent directory as their working directory not /var/tmp!

- Add a FrameRunning item to the JQueueJobViewerPanel menu.

- NodeBrowser labels are truncated ("SomeLa...") sometimes. 

- Implement Import (source links, per-source action parameters) in NodeViewer.

- Thumbnail display options in the NodeViewer

- NodeLinks Panel?

- Task/Scheduling Panels

- Improved UI for panel save/restore.  Its sort of clunky but works currently...

- NodeViewer contents are not intialized to the selected nodes in the linked NodeBrowser 
  when the panel type is changed to NodeViewer from some other type of panel.

- NodeBrowser contents are not intialized to the selected nodes in the linked NodeViewer 
  when the panel type is changed to NodeBrowser from some other type of panel.

- Check for duplicate hotkeys in the same group when changing a hot key.

- When layouts are restored, there can be conflicts between multiple update tasks and 
  problems of some components not being instatiated yet at the point of update.  A more
  methodical system needs to replace the current ad hoc system.

- Sorting the JobBrowser clears the current selection - it should be preserved.

- Add Tooltips in JobViewer that display the "[123] PrimaryTarget.#.gif" title. 

- Add Tooltips for title labels in ALL panels!

- The Action Enabled field in the NodeDetails panel is always cyan!  

- Command-line client program similar to the old pipeline(1)?

- Add optional hot key reminders in menu item names.


IMPORTANT UNIMPLEMENTED JOB RELATED ISSUES:

+ The Edit/Edit With operations should generate a warning when a job is Queue/Running for
  the target file(s).

+ When critical modifications are performed on a node, any running jobs associated with the
  node should immediately be killed/aborted.  Ideally, a dialog should give the user the 
  choice of killing the jobs or cancelling the operation.

  Critical modifications can come from Link/Unlink, Add/Remove Secondary, Check-Out, Rename, 
  as well as from the modifyProperties() method.

+ The Renumber operation should kill any running jobs which generate frames which will be 
  obsolete in the new frame range.  If the Execution Method is Serial, all running jobs should
  be killed.

+ The Release/RemoveFiles operations should also kill any running jobs associated with 
  the node.
