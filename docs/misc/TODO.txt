ACTIONS:

+ Write Action classes for the remaining common CG tasks...  Finish Output OP support 
  in Houdini.  Add all supported Maya renderer related actions: MentalRay and Maya Renderers.
  Maya simulation actions: particle systems, dynamics, cloth, fluid dynamics.  Generic MEL
  action.  Add 3Delight rendering.  XSI supprt?  Simple compositing actions?

+ Create a BooleanParameter class.  UI is a JComboBox containing "Yes" or "No".

+ Create an EnumParameter class.  UI is a JComboBox containing the set of 
  enumerations.  The BooleanParameter class could simply be a subclass of this class
  with harcoded "Yes" and "No" enumerations.



COMMAND LINE:

+ Add commands/options for setting JobReqs for nodes and running jobs.

+ Add commands/options for setting QueueServer selection keys/biases for the pipeline user.

+ Add command/options for adding license keys and changing the max number for the 
  pipeline user.

+ Add command/options for adding selection keys for the pipeline user.

+ Add command/options for adding/removing normal users to the database for the pipeline user.



UI LOOK AND FEEL:

+ Fix the buf in JDetailsDialog which caused the scroll pane to scroll to the bottom
  after updateState() is called.  The problem only occurs when nodes have log messages.
  It may be caused by the new Swing components being generated or might be related to 
  the fact that nodes with log messages neccesarily have PNodes in addition to PMods... 

+ The JDetailsDialog also expands the file entries horizonally when resized, but will
  never make them smaller when the window border is moved.

+ The JWaitDialog occasionally leaves junk on the screen. Only seems to happen
  when the task is very short.  Possibly some thread misbehavior... 

+ Add downstream and birectional layouts in addition to the current upstream tree
  layout for the JNodeViewer.

+ Add vertical and radial layout schemes to the JNodeViewer.

+ The horizontal scroll bar in the ActionOutput section of JQueueJobDetailsDialog 
  can be offscreen if the text is long...



DATABASE / PIPELINE COMMANDS: 

+ References.  Add a new way to connect nodes which has a similar usage as dependencies
  but specified only relationship not functionality.  A PRef would be associated 
  with a PVersion (as with PDepend) and contain the following information:

     Name      Name of the node referenced.
     Version   Specific version of the node referenced.
     Type      Type of Reference (StyleFrame, LocationPhotos, etc...)     


+ plget/set should be extended to preserve file permissions (specifically execute).
  
+ plget/set should be executed on the fileserver via ssh to improve preformance and 
  allow non-Linux users (Mac/NT) to fully user pipeline.

+ Replace Make/Queue with a native Pipeline queue.
