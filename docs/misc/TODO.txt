- Add thumbnail generation method?


OPERATIONS/BACKEND: 

- Task/Scheduling System

- Would caching of checksums improve the performance of the FileMgr?


ADMINISTRATION: 

- Automated Backup of Node/Queue database and production working areas.

- Node and File Online/Offline System


USER INTERFACE: 

- Improved UI for panel save/restore.  Its sort of clunky but works currently...

- NodeViewer contents are not intialized to the selected nodes in the linked NodeBrowser 
  when the panel type is changed to NodeViewer from some other type of panel.

- NodeBrowser contents are not intialized to the selected nodes in the linked NodeViewer 
  when the panel type is changed to NodeBrowser from some other type of panel.

- When layouts are restored, there can be conflicts between multiple update tasks and 
  problems of some components not being instatiated yet at the point of update.  A more
  methodical system needs to replace the current ad hoc system.


STATE/JOB BUGS

- Job submission should traverse the entire tree upstream of the root job node and not
  stop when it encounters a node without an action.  Job dependencies should bridge any 
  number of nodes without actions between the target job and source job(s).




IMPORTANT UNIMPLEMENTED JOB RELATED ISSUES:

+ The Edit/Edit With operations should generate a warning when a job is Queue/Running for
  the target file(s).

+ When critical modifications are performed on a node, any running jobs associated with the
  node should immediately be killed/aborted.  Ideally, a dialog should give the user the 
  choice of killing the jobs or cancelling the operation.

  Critical modifications can come from Link/Unlink, Add/Remove Secondary, Check-Out, Rename, 
  as well as from the modifyProperties() method.

+ The Renumber operation should kill any running jobs which generate frames which will be 
  obsolete in the new frame range.  If the Execution Method is Serial, all running jobs should
  be killed.

+ The Release/RemoveFiles operations should also kill any running jobs associated with 
  the node.
