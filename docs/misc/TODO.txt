IMPORTANT UNIMPLEMENTED JOB RELATED ISSUES:

+ The Edit/Edit With operations should generate a warning when a job is Queue/Running for
  the target file(s).

+ When critical modifications are performed on a node, any running jobs associated with the
  node should immediately be killed/aborted.  Ideally, a dialog should give the user the 
  choice of killing the jobs or cancelling the operation.

  Critical modifications can come from Link/Unlink, Add/Remove Secondary, Check-Out, Rename, 
  as well as from the modifyProperties() method.

+ The Renumber operation should kill any running jobs which generate frames which will be 
  obsolete in the new frame range.  If the Execution Method is Serial, all running jobs should
  be killed.

+ The Release operation should also kill any running jobs associated with the released node.
