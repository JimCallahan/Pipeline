pljobd(8): 

  Is run on every machine which is configured for running Pipeline jobs.  Listens for 
  network connections from plserverd(8).  Each connection spawns a new thread which 
  then listens on the connection for input from plserverd(8) in the form of serialized 
  Java objects.

  If the initial object sent by plserverd(8) is a Job object, the thread registers 
  itself in a synchronized table indexed by Job.getID().  The thread then starts a 
  OS level process for the Job.  The thread collects the output from the OS process 
  and sends each line of output (either stdout or stderr) from the process back to 
  plserverd(8) over the same connection as a JobOutput object.  Finally, when the OS level 
  process exits the exit code is captured and sent as a JobComplete object to plserverd(8).
  After sending the JobComplete object, the thread removes itself from the thread table
  and then exits.
  
  If the initial object sent by plserverd(8) is instead a JobKill object, the thread looks
  up the thread running job (previous section) and sends a kill signal to the OS process.
  This thread then sends a Acknowledged object back to plserverd(8) and exits.
