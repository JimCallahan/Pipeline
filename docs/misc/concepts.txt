Data Nodes (graphical information):

  + Rounded Rectangular Shape

  + Short Name (long name as hint)

  + StatusRsp (iconic indented symbol) 
    - Registered: blank

    - Locally Modified: delta symbol
    - Has Conflicts: "X" 
    - Needs Check-out: "!"
    - Missing Files: "?"
    - Modified Depend: upside down delta symbol

  + Queue Status (color) 
    - Pending: green
    - Running: yellow  (more accurately, the process node dependency is running) 
      + How should progress on multi-file nodes be represented? As Left-to-right 
        color change from running to finished colors?
    - Failure: red  (the process node dependency, or one of its dependencies, failed)
    - Finished: blue  (same as not queued?)

    - Locally Modified: delta symbol
    - Has Conflicts: "X" 
    - Needs Check-out: "!"

User Interaction:

  + Nodes:
    - First button click makes node the sole selection.

    - Shift first button click adds/removes node from selection list.  If a node is added to
      the selection list, all links are removed from the list.

    - First button mouse click-and-drag from one node to another adds a dependency.  If the 
      target node is a data node, then the previous dependency is replaced.

    - Second button click-and-drag moves layout position of node (or of all selected nodes if 
      the selection list is not empty).

    - "delete" key invokes a "pipeline revoke" on all selected nodes with a "Registered"
      status.  Nodes which have been previously checked-in are ignored (maybe with a warning?).

    - Third button click brings up Action popup menu.  Items which are not appropriate given
      the current status (since the last status action) of the node are greyed out.  

      + Status: Does a "pipeline status --follow" on the node and updates the UI to reflect
                any changes since the last status action.

      + CheckIn: Brings up dialog with a text editor for checkin log message and optional 
                 specific version selection field.  Confirmation starts the check-in.  If 
                 any problems are encountered, a error dialog will report the problems.

      + CheckOut: Brings up dialog allowing optional selection of a specific version or date.
                  Confirmation starts the check-out.  If any problems are encountered, a error 
                  dialog will report the problems.

      + Comment: Does a "pipeline comment"


  + Links:
    - First button click makes link the sole selection.

    - Shift first button click adds/removes links from selection list.  If a link is added to 
      the selection list, all nodes are removed from the list.
 
    - "delete" key removes the selected links (i.e. the dependencies of the target nodes).
    

  + Background Area:
    - First button click empties the selection list.

    - Second button click-and-drag pans the viewer.

    - First-and-second button click-and-drag zooms the viewer.

  + Selected nodes are displayed in this UI.

  + Node Properties:  
    - Same general layout as "pipeline status --long --show=all" with each section represented
      as a collapsable pane.  Similar to Maya's "Action Editor" format... 

    - The fields settable via "pipeline modify" are editable and trigger that pipeline 
      command when changed.  

    - The "files" section should also show queue status information for each file.
