First impression notes:

 + When browsing for a place to export the toolset to, single-clicking opened directories.  
   This is counter-intuitive to both windows and linux which use double-clicking to open 
   directories when file-browsing.

 + The home button looks too much like an up arrow.  It needs a chimney or something to make 
   it more houselike.

 + I want better mouse access to the pipeline dropdown menu.  I want to be able to click 
   anywhere and pull it up.  Ctl-mm or something. 

 + I want to be able to right click in the file browser and register a node, and have it 
   default to the directory that I clicked on in the browser.

 + I also want hotkey access to things like split right and to switching to different 
   panel types.

 + Shift-clicking on a plus sign in the node browser should expand everything underneath 
   it (just like in the maya outliner). shift-clicking again should cause it all to fold up.

 + I want the ability to register a node without closing the register window (like in the 
   old pipeline).

 + There doesn't seem to be a way to check-in multiple files at once.  This was in the last 
   pipeline and would be very nice to have back.

 + As well, there does not seem to be the check-in message history, which was also very 
   useful.

 + Multiple node check-out.  When multiple nodes are selected, a revision number collection
   field should be shown for each node in the Check-Out dialog and all check-outs performed
   at once when the dialog is confirmed.

 + Allow non-privileged users to Disable/Enable their local machine and set the Reservation
   to their own user name or clear the reservation.
