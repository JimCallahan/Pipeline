Archive Tool: 

   + The search criteria or node version filter (modal sub-dialog):

      - Name Pattern
          A regular expression used to match fully resolved node names.  If (null), all 
          node names match.

      - Exclude Latest
          The number of checked-in versions of the node to exclude from the list.  Versions
          are excluded in latest to oldest order.  A value of 0 or (null) means that all 
          versions are included.  A value of (2) would exclude the two most recent versions.
       
      - Maximum Working
          The maximum number of existing working versions based on the checked-in version
          in order for the checked-in version to be included in the list.  A value of 0 or 
          (null) means that no working versions may exist in order for the checked-in 
          version to be included.  

      - Maximum Backups
          The maximum number of copies of the checked-in version which have already been
          backed up in order for the version to be included.
	  

   + Candidate Versions Table (left):

      Table containing the checked-in versions which match the search criteria.  Each 
      checked-in version is listed as a row in the table with the following columns:

      - Name
          Fully resolved node name.

      - Version
	  Revision number of the checked-in version.

      - Checked-In 
	  The timestamp of when the checked-in version was created.

      - Checked-Out
	  The timestamp of the last check-out of the version.

      - Working 
	  The number of working versions in existence based on the checked-in version.

      - Archive
           The timestamp of when the last archive which contained the version was created.

      - Copies
          The number of previously created archives which contain this checked-in version.

 
    + Left/Right Arrow Buttons: 

        - Left button removes all selected checked-in versions from the Selected Version
	  Table.

        - Right button adds the checked-in versions selected in the Candidate Version Table
          to the Selected Version Table.

    + Selected Versions Table (right);

        Contains the versions selected for archiving.  Each checked-in version is 
	listed as a row in the table with the following columns:

        - Name
            The fully resolved node name.

        - Version
            The revision number of the checked-in version.
 
        - Archive
            An editable boolean field which indicates that the checked-in verison's files
            should be archived.  This field is set to TRUE by default.

        - Offline
            An editable boolean field which indicates that the checked-in version's files 
            should be deleted from the repository after the archive has been successfully 
	    created. This field is set to FALSE by default.

            This field will be set to (null) and disabled for editing if:

              + A working version exists in any working area which is based on the 
                checked-in version.

              + This is the latest checked-in version and any working version of the 
	        node exists in any working area.

              + There are no existing archives which contain the files associated with 
                this checked-in version and the Archive flag is set to FALSE.

        
     + Buttons: 

        - Archive
            Shows a dialog which contains: 

            + "Archiver" Drawer 

                - Archive Prefix
                    The prefix of the archive name.  A timestamp string will be appended 
                    to this prefix to generate the archive name(s).


                - Archiver
                    The name of the Archiver plugin to use. 
 
                - Version
                    The version of the Archiver plugin to use.

                - Archiver Params ... 

            + "Stats" Drawer

                - Total Size
                    The total size of all files being archived

                - Archive Capacity
                    The maximum size of an individual archive (based on Archiver).

                - Archive Count
                    The total number of archives which will be created.

            If this dialog is confirmed, the selected Archiver plugin is run for each archive,

            If the plugin runs successfully, the archive name will be added to the cached
            pArchiveNames field of the MasterMgr and a GLUE representation of the archive
            will be written to disk.  If there is an archive failure, a dialog will be shown
            which notified the user of the failure and queries whether to attempt the 
            remaining archives.

            Once all archives have been processed, the versions marked for offlining will
            be processed.  Any versions which were marked for archive but whos archive
            failed will be skipped.  For each file to be offlined:

            - Check to see there exist any later versions of the file are symbolic links
              which point to the file being offlined.  If links are found, move the file
              to be offlined to the location of the link with the lowest version number
              and change the remaining links to point to this new location.  

            - Otherwise, simply remove the file to be offlined.

            Add the checked-in verision name and revision number to the cached table of 
            offlined versions.  Write this table to disk after all versions have been 
            processed.

Restore Tool:

   + Requested Versions Table (left):

        Table containing the checked-in versions which users have requested to be restored.
        Each requested checked-in version is listed as a row in the table with the following 
        columns:

        - Name
            Fully resolved node name.

        - Version
	    Revision number of the checked-in version.

 
    + Left/Right Arrow Buttons: 

        - Left button removes all selected checked-in versions from the Selected Version
	  Table.

        - Right button adds the checked-in versions selected in the Requested Versions Table
          to the Selected Version Table.

    + Selected Versions Table (right);

        Contains the versions selected for restoration.  Each checked-in version is 
	listed as a row in the table with the following columns:

        - Name
            The fully resolved node name.

        - Version
            The revision number of the checked-in version.
 
        - Archives...
            A column for each archive which contains one of the checked-in versions.  The

            version.  The columns are listed from newest to oldest (left to right).
