      When <SPAN class="c2">plmaster</SPAN>(1) is properly
      shutdown, it saves some cached information to disk which is
      read during the next startup to reduce startup time.&nbsp; If
      <SPAN class="c2">plmaster</SPAN>(1) fails to write these
      cache files due to a system crash or some other catastrophic
      failure, they can be rebuilt using this option.&nbsp; Note
      that <SPAN class="c2">plmaster</SPAN>(1) will not start
      unless these cache files exist or this option is given.&nbsp;
      This means that the first time <SPAN class=
      "c2">plmaster</SPAN>(1) is started, this option must be
      given.<BR>

      <BR>
      Normally, whem <SPAN class="c2">plmaster</SPAN>(1) starts up
      it reads and then removes the database file containing the
      list of currently offlined repository node versions.&nbsp;
      When shutdown properly, this offlined versions cache file is
      written back to disk.&nbsp; If <SPAN class=
      "c2">plmaster</SPAN>(1) exits abruptly due to a failure or
      hardware problem, the offined versions cache must be rebuilt
      from scratch by scanning the production repository
      directories.&nbsp; Usually, this behavior is desirable since
      it insures that the offlined version cache is always
      up-to-date.&nbsp; However, for very large production file
      systems this rescan can be very time consuming and sometimes
      it would be convienent to be able to avoid this rescanning
      process.<BR>
      <BR>
      This option will prevent <SPAN class="c2">plmaster</SPAN>(1)
      from removing the offlined versions cache file after
      startup.&nbsp; If given with the --rebuild option,
      <SPAN class="c2">plmaster</SPAN>(1) will read any existing
      offlined versions cache file instead of rebuilding it after
      an unclean shutdown.&nbsp; This option also forces
      <SPAN class="c2">plmaster</SPAN>(1) to save the offline
      versions cache file after each offline/restore
      operation.&nbsp; This should greatly speed up the rebuild
      process for studios with large production file systems, but
      is inherently dangerous since the offlined versions cache
      file is not strictly guarenteed to be up-to-date if a failure
      occurs during an offline/restore operation.<BR>

      Run the Pipeline file manager as an internal thread of

      file manager as a standalone <A href=
      "plfilemgr.html"><SPAN class="c2">plfilemgr</SPAN></A>(1)
      daemon.&nbsp; This option can only be used if the host
      configured to run the <SPAN class="c2">plmaster</SPAN>(1) and
      <A href="plfilemgr.html"><SPAN class=
      "c2">plfilemgr</SPAN></A>(1) daemons are identical.&nbsp; See

      When the file manager and master manager are running on the
      same host, it is preferable that this option is used to
      reduce the network overhead and eliminate the need to run a
      second Java Virtual Machine process.&nbsp; However, if the
      best performance can usually be obtained by running the file
      manager as the <A href="plfilemgr.html"><SPAN class=
      "c2">plfilemgr</SPAN></A>(1) daemon on the network file
      server so that the heavy file system activity of the file
      manger can be performed locally and not over NFS.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      When this is not possible or desirable to run <A href=
      "plfilemgr.html"><SPAN class="c2">plfilemgr</SPAN></A>(1) on
      the network file server, the next best option is to run the

    Garbage Collector Parameters</A></SPAN></SPAN></H4>Pipeline
    maintains an in memory cache of frequently accessed database
    information to accelerate node status updates and other node
    related operations. There are separate caches for working and
    checked-in node versions as well as for working checksums and
    per-node annotatations. For ideal performance, these kinds of
    node related data would only be read from disk once and then
    looked up from cache for all subsequent accesses. However for
    medium to large scale productions this could easily require
    more memory than is available on the host running the server.
    Therefore, Pipeline manages the sizes of these caches to
    minimize both total memory usage and the number of times that
    data has to be read (or re-read) from disk.<BR>
    <BR>
    For each cache, Pipeline maintains a minumum and maximum number
    of items that should be cached. When free memory is available,
    these sizes are dynamically increased so that the current
    number of items in the cache becomes the new minimum. The
    maximum size is computed from the new minimum using the Caching
    Factor (see <A href=
    "#--cache-factor"><STRONG>--cache-factor</STRONG></A>). When
    free memory becomes low the maximum size is reset to the
    current size and a new minimum size is computed using the Cache
    Factor. If at any time, the number of items currently cached is
    equal-to or more than the maximum size then the cache garbage
    collector is invoked. The amount of free memory which this
    algorithm tries to maintain is automatically computed from the
    total JMV heap size, but can be specified directly (see
    <A href="#--min-free-memory"><STRONG>--min-free-memory</STRONG></A>).<BR>

    <BR>
    The entire cache garbage collection process, which begins by
    checking free memory and then resizing each cache, is initiated
    by one of two conditions. The first condition is that a timer
    has expired which triggers the cache garbage collection at
    regular intervals (See <A href=
    "#--gc-interval"><STRONG>--gc-interval</STRONG></A>). The
    second condition is that a certain number of items (see
    <A href="#--gc-misses"><STRONG>--gc-misses</STRONG></A>) have
    be accessed which were missing from the cache and needed to be
    loaded from disk, thereby increasing the sizes of the caches.
    Either condition may initiate a cache garbage collection. The
    first condition is primarily concerned with deteacting and
    reacting to changes in the amount of non-cache free memory. The
    second condition allows the cache garbage collector to react
    quickly to rapid increases in the size of caches due to user
    activity and keep their sizes under control to prevent the JVM
    from running out of memory.<BR>
    <BR>
    The garbage collector for a specific cache operates by removing
    items from the cache in the order they were first inserted. So
    the entire cache acts like a FIFO who's size can temporarily
    grow above the maximum size computed above but is reduced to
    the minimum size each time the cache garbage collector is
    invoked. As long as the current number of items is less than
    the cache maximum size, no steps are taken to reduce the items
    cached. So most invocations of the cache garbage collector
    merely involve adjusting the minimum and maximum sizes of the
    caches, which is extremely fast. Even when the size of a
    particular cache must be reduced, very little effort or locking
    is involved in the process. The biggest impact of a large
    reduction of one or more of these caches will be the triggering
    of a JVM level heap garbage collection cycle.<BR>
    <BR>
    The following parameters can be used to tune Pipeline's use of
    caching:<BR>

      Overrides the default amount of memory (<SPAN class=
      "c4">bytes</SPAN>) that should be reserved for normal JVM
      operation and heap garbage collection overhead. Great care
      should be taken if you choose to override this parameter. If
      the free memory is set too high it will lead to poor
      performance due to excessive file I/O since the caches will
      have to shrink to accomodate the extra memory reserved for
      the JVM. On the other hand, setting free memory too low can
      lead to a crash of the JVM due to an out-of-memory error. If
      you think your performance can be improved by adjusting this
      parameter its probably best to consult with someone from
      Temerity Software before changing it.<BR>

      The default value is approximately 1/5th of the total JVM

      Overrides the number of cache misses (<SPAN class=

      collection before the normal amount of time between periodic
      collections. A cache miss occurs when an item is accessed
      which does not currently reside in the cache and has to be
      read from a file on disk. Therefore cache misses are a good
      indication of growth in the memory footprint of the

      Sets the ratio (<SPAN class="c4">percentage</SPAN>) as a real
      number in the range [0.5-0.95] between the minimum and
      maximum sizes for each cache. As mentioned above, the cache
      garbage collection algorithm periodically resizes the caches
      based on available memory and usage pattern. When a resizing
      occurs, one of either minimum or maximum size is set and the
      other computing using this factor. A high factor would lead
      to more frequent, but less agressive reductions in the number
      of items in a cache when memory is low. A low factor would
      lead to less frequent and more aggressive reductions during
      each pass of the collector. The default value is likely
      pretty close to ideal in most situations.<BR>

      continually dynamically resized during operation of the cache
      garbage collector, changing the value with these parameters
      is only really useful to help the collector more quickly
      converge to a reasonable size.<BR>
