Directory Structure:

  tools		Programs used as part of the build process.
  libs 		Shared code packaged into libraries.
  utils		A collection of small utility programs in one directory.
  apps		Large complex programs with their own directory structure.



The haiku build instructions:

  $ tar -zxvf Phoenix-0.1.tgz
  $ cd Phoenix-0.1
  $ ./configure --enable-threads --disable-opt
  $ make all
  $ make check


See "configure --help" for a full list of options.  If you mess around
with the "configure.in", you should run the "./autogen.sh" just to be
safe.
