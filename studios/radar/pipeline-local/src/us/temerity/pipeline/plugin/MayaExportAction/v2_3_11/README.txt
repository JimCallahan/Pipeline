This plugin was created at Radar and is currently required by some of the nodes used
there.  It is not supported by Temerity Software, nor is it based upon the MayaExport
v2.3.10 version created by Temerity.  It was a mistake for Radar to have created this 
with a Vendor of "Temerity", but now that it exists we cannot easily remove it from 
their existing node networks.
